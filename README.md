# Sapling

Our Application helps us to monitor the planted tree saplings. Which ensures the need and safety of the saplings.
1)	Volunteer will plant the tree sapling and update the location in our application.
2)	The nearby people will get notify about the new sapling, based on their interest they can contribute by providing water, manure, fencing etc.,
3)	Then they will update their work, which helps other volunteer to the next level.

Note*: Not everyone will get time/money to plant a tree sapling.

Some people has money but don’t have enough time to maintain/grow a tree
